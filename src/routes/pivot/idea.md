I think -- we already know what every slide will contain -- even if there are 100 million slides we know their content exectly ---- eachslide will be the shape as give at the end 

1: This is the object that we will ever recieve -- there can be more types only we add to it.
2: the content /structure will remainthe same no matter what the slide is about =====> only the english or numbers or image urls will change
3: the layout and content helth checking is simple as checking the number of characters suiutable for each slide
4: the deckbuilder CAN NOT build json that will break -> if a json is comming from deckbuilder it can not be wrong
5: when we update api we also update deck 1 generates other consumes
6: we can run every every analytics under the sun on this structure ...
