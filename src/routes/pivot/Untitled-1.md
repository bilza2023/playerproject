Background Requirements:
you can change if you have better idea

1: We have adefault bg that gets changed and drawn --- any slide with bg merges with global bg
2: once a slide sets a bf or it is set by default it stays the same for rest of the slides
3: bg at start must have selected theme color

const defaultBackground = {
backgroundColor: "#d5edd5", <<< == themeClass
backgroundImage: null,
backgroundImageOpacity: 1
};
