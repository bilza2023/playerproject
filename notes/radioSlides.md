### üéß Why ‚ÄúRadio Slides‚Äù?

Because they're built like **radio shows** ‚Äî audio-first, visual-second.

* In **traditional slides**, the visuals are primary:
  ‚Üí You design the slide, *then* narrate over it.
  ‚Üí The structure is visual logic: titles, bullets, images.

* In **radio slides**, the *narration is the skeleton*.
  ‚Üí You speak first ‚Äî freely, passionately, like a radio monologue.
  ‚Üí Then visuals are crafted to **match mood, rhythm, and flow**.
  ‚Üí Often, there‚Äôs **no script**, just a raw voice rant.

### üß† Why it matters:

This flips the **authoring priority**:

* üéß Voice defines the beats
* üñºÔ∏è Visuals become expressive layers ‚Äî not information blocks
* üìú Text (if any) follows emotional structure, not outline logic

Think: **‚Äúvoice-led storytelling‚Äù** ‚Üí radio ‚Üí then add ‚Äúslides‚Äù ‚Üí *radio slides*.

It‚Äôs not just a term ‚Äî it‚Äôs a production philosophy.

### üéß Radio Slides ‚Äî Internal Structure & Design

**Definition**:
Radio slides are a distinct `type: "radio"` in our deck system ‚Äî built for voice-led storytelling.

#### ‚úÖ At the Deck Level:

* No special treatment.
* **Same format** as any other slide.
* Passed to `deck.add()` like `full`, `half`, etc.
* Stored and processed identically in the slide JSON.

> üìå **They are just another slide type.** Nothing changes in the data structure.

#### üñõÔ∏è At the Player Level:

* Radio slides have their **own dedicated components**
  (e.g. `SlideRadio.svelte`) that handle:

  * Voice sync
  * Subtitles
  * Ambient visuals
  * Slide triggers based on narration cues

> üìå Component-level difference only ‚Äî not a schema or API-level shift.

#### ‚ôªÔ∏è Why This Matters:

* Keeps the **deck engine unified**
* Allows authoring to stay consistent
* Enables mixed decks: `["full", "radio", "half", "radio", "quote"]`

You don‚Äôt need to branch logic ‚Äî just render each slide by type.
Radio is just one more face of the same deck format.

### üí° What should a ‚ÄúRadio Slide‚Äù *feel like*?

Let‚Äôs shape it by **intent, not just structure**:

* **Immersion**: The slide should feel *like a story playing out*, not a lesson being unpacked.
* **Flow**: No hard "steps" or clicks ‚Äî visuals just **follow voice rhythm**.
* **Emotion-first**: Instead of ‚Äúshow point A,‚Äù it‚Äôs ‚Äú*feel moment A*‚Äù ‚Äî tone, color, image, subtitle.
* **Atomic Scene**: One radio slide = one narrative beat ‚Üí not modular, not bullet-driven.

### üß† What it should *impact*:

* **Authoring mindset**: You record first. Then *react* with visuals ‚Äî opposite of EQ.
* **Deck mood**: Feels like a short film inside your deck. You **listen** more than read.
* **Presentation pace**: No user interaction ‚Äî just sit back and experience.
* **Use cases**: Story intros, emotional explainers, ‚Äúmoment of silence,‚Äù personal reflections.

### üõ†Ô∏è Execution Difference: Radio Slides vs EQ/Canvas

In **EQ/Canvas**, you design *frame-by-frame*, second-by-second ‚Äî every bullet, icon, and move has an exact `start` and `end`.

But in **Radio Slides**, we flip it:

> ‚úÖ You give **coarse time segments** (e.g., 5‚Äì100s)
> ‚úÖ Each segment includes **minimal metadata**: `title`, `icons[]`, `bullets[]`
> ‚úÖ The component **auto-generates** a rich timeline experience from that

### üåÄ How It Plays Out:

* A **ticker bar** runs at the bottom ‚Üí each segment shows its title
* **Icons rotate in/out** slowly over that segment's span
* **Bullets auto-sequence** using a rhythm (e.g., every 4‚Äì6 seconds)
* You can **optionally override timing**, but you rarely need to
* The layout reads: *"You're listening to something. Here's what it's about ‚Äî visually."*

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Key Differentiator

> **EQ is precise choreography.**
> **Radio is loose direction with expressive rendering.**

The slide becomes a *visual atmosphere*, not a strict instruction.

### ‚ú® Authoring Power: Mood + Preset System

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Mood-Based Rendering

Each segment includes a `mood` tag that drives visual expression:

* `mood: "motivation"` ‚Üí bright tones, upward motion
* `mood: "deliberation"` ‚Üí cool tones, slow fades
* `mood: "warning"` ‚Üí flashes, muted bg, urgent pacing

> Mood = design preset + animation style + ambient color

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Presets for Authoring

Example segment:

```json
{
  start: 40,
  end: 120,
  preset: "motivation.basic",
  title: "Push Through Doubt",
  bullets: ["You are already in motion", "Doubt fades with action"],
  icons: ["lightning", "steps"]
}
```

Presets define:

* Icon logic
* Backgrounds
* Bullet rhythm
* Mood palette

Radio slides become **emotionally scripted containers**, with minimal config, high payoff.
