title: User Messaging Draft (Dialogue System)
description: Draft plan for Taleem.Help's student ↔ system messaging structure
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧭 Overview

We are designing a lightweight but expandable messaging system for Taleem.Help. It behaves as a **dialogue model**, not a generic log. The system represents conversations between a **user (student)** and the **system (admin, GPT, or automation)**. Each message is stored as a document with clear directionality and purpose.

## 🔁 Message Flow Philosophy

* Every message is part of a **two-party thread**: one `userId`, and one `system` sender.
* There are only two valid `senderType` values: `"user"` and `"system"`.
* A message **may reply to another** via a `replyTo` field, referencing the `_id` of the original message.

## 🧱 Core Message Schema (Mongo)

```ts
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  userId: string, // required
  senderType: "user" | "system",
  content: string,
  tags: string[], // e.g. ["confusion", "feedback"]
  tcodeRef: string, // optional: "fbise9physics:1.3"
  replyTo: ObjectId | null, // if this is a response to a previous message
  createdAt: ISODate,
}
```

## 📬 Submitting Messages

Users can send messages from any slide or page. These will be submitted with:

* `senderType: "user"`
* `userId` (derived from token)
* `content`
* Optional `tags` and `tcodeRef`

These are processed and stored in the `messages` collection.

## 🤖 System Replies

When the system (admin, AI, or automation) replies:

* A new message is created with `senderType: "system"`
* It links back to the original via `replyTo`
* Same `userId` is retained

The frontend inbox groups replies by `replyTo` to show clean threads.

## 🧭 Ticketing Behavior

This is functionally a **ticketing system**, but without heavy-weight protocols.
Each user message represents a new thread.

> Threads can be filtered by tags, tcodeRef, or open/answered status (future).

We may eventually add `status: "open" | "replied" | "resolved"` to enhance admin dashboards.

## 🧠 Design Benefits

* 🔒 No role-checks or polymorphic senders
* 📂 Easily extensible for GPT replies, analysis, or logs
* 💬 UI logic is trivial: render by `replyTo`

## 🚫 What It’s Not

* Not a general log system
* Not a forum/thread for many users
* Not for system → system messages

## 🛠 Tooling

| Purpose             | Tool      |
| ------------------- | --------- |
| ID generation       | `nanoid`  |
| Validation          | `zod`     |
| Date formatting     | `dayjs`   |
| UI State (optional) | `zustand` |

## ✅ Final Decision Summary

* `messages` collection stores all communication
* Only `user` and `system` are valid senders
* Replies are separate messages linked via `replyTo`
* No `systemMessages` for logs — this is purely for student ↔ system dialogue
* All messages must be tied to a `userId`

This system becomes the foundation of AbdulNet — the intelligent feedback loop between student intent and automated response.
