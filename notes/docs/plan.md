Perfect — here's your clean 3-step milestone plan:

---

### ✅ Step 1: **Basic Setup (Auth + Shell)**

* ✅ Set up SQLite + Prisma backend
* ✅ Create routes for `register`, `login`, and `me`
* ✅ Issue JWTs and validate on protected routes
* ✅ Build minimal frontend:

  * Login screen
  * Register screen
  * Basic authenticated shell (e.g., “Hi, User” + Logout)

---

### 💬 Step 2: **Messaging**

* ✅ Add `messages` table (support system + user messages)
* ✅ Connect messages to logged-in user
* ✅ Enable sending + viewing messages
* ✅ Backend only, frontend minimal (textbox + list)
* ✅ Structure designed to be readable by Workshop

---

### 📚 Step 3: **TCodes / Syllabus / Content Mapping**

* ✅ Add `tcodes` (topics / units)
* ✅ Define schema for syllabus data
* ✅ Setup routes to list + fetch tcode content
* ✅ Optional: simple dashboard for content view
* ✅ Workshop starts pulling these as static JSON snapshots

---

Each step is self-contained and testable.
