✍️ Let’s Forge the Manifesto
🧭 Action Tape: A Mini-Manifesto

Action Tape is a log-first system design where:

Every meaningful behavior is recorded as a message

Messages are append-only, typed, and optionally tagged

Runtime stores nothing beyond the event itself

All logic, interpretation, and computation are deferred

No schema decisions are made at capture time

Only the Workshop — an offline, AI-assisted compiler — transforms logs into structured insights

Static builds, not live mutations, power the user experience

It prioritizes trustable replay over fragile calculation
