# Notes

1: we want the out put in single .md format no code etc


2: We are preparing slides for each section of the uploaded .pdf book. This is federal board physics . we are covering the book sectio by section , so far done section 1.1 only

3: We go presentation by presentation . we may have to break a section in more than 1 presentation but over all we follow the book structure.

4: The narration section should have as much help material for this topic as possible 

5: These lesson for for Pakistani student mainly in rawalpindi , islamabad , studing federal board . they are from middle and upper middle class. Basic language is urdu (punjabi is less ). keep naraation accordingly

5: minimum slide duration is 2 sec

6: Make sure that the content does not out-grown the canvas and also if it has image side by side then not covert it

7: Look afor if  images are broken, use default images if user has not given as start

8: if image is  covered and image is not important remove image if problematic.
if you show some thing show it well or dont show. you should let me know how many characters and font size you use when you get this complaint about content cutting the image-- mark that and do not exceed

9 : Rule of side by side bullets and image - if there is any chance that image will covert the content and image is just for decoration remove it. if image is important show it on seperate slide

10 :same mistake again and again -- what is so hard about it -- do not cut content for useless images-- dont use images with bullets always it is not a must use full with bullets -- enought of this one mistake
