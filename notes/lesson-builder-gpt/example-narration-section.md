=================

1:  The narration section is also a seperate section from the slides section how ever it is written such that narration is tied to the slides (obviously) . so first slides section is completed and then the narration-section is completed. It is written slide by slide 

2: The narration is not a speech or what the teacher has to say , it is just research , point , data , numbers  , 

3: also the narration section have intructions about tone, which words to use which not to use.
