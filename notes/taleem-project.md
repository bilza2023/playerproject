In this chat we will talk about ==> 1: Technical Team : only


Our main product is ==> A simple videos (it actually a presentation). in very simple words as an online educational company all we sell are online presentations. these presentations are grouped as courses etc. it is a simple online content (educational) seller on SAAS basis.--dont you agree


since our main products are out presentations so this has to be the main TARGET -- i think it is reasonable to make "Number of Presentations Available Online" as the first KPI and lets build around that.


consider this 
        ==> All the syllabus goverment has approved for class 8,9,10 are what we are converting into presentations question by questions , chapter by chapter , book by book. --> This is the main concept of this educational company --> Please temm me do you agree.. make a sepertae heading of this answer in you answer.

Each presentation when made available should have passed all these tests.


    1: all the content must be correct (we have a button for students to upload their problems also)
    2: All the images required should be available 
    3: The narration should be available and correct.
    4: The diagrams uploaded must be correct and valid for educational formay
    5: slide data should have correct timings to keep it in sync with the narration.

The process of a presentation start to end shoudl be divided into stages (3-4) stages seems correct.

the last stage should just be a review of the presentation by all the team and finalizing it OR demoting it and taking notes.

===> This company is just a machine which takes goverment approved syllabus and convert it into presentations.. do you agree?

-- we should start with 1 chapter another chapter==> 1 book at a time and 1 chapter at a time (this is what i suggest) .. 
-- i think when each chapter is discussed all the images , icons , images , etc etc required should be worked out so that these assets are available. style of presentation (we have canvas slides and eq slides seperate for more image based or content /line/line with some images on wide bar )
-- people responsible for the narration etc etc


--- actually this is where i need you help rest all is to educate you


important POINT==> i am open to using some project management tool like slack etc if the process that you decide needs it .. i am ok with either slack OR "NOTION" . i am currently using notion and it is great for small teams if you say
