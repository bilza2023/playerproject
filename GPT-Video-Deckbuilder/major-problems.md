Major Problems is Presentations.

1: Long and Large Text ::: First and main problem is that adding more content with out taking care of its size and width. Long test get cut since it leaves the screen-
==> Best Rule use less text and if text is more reduce font

==> very bad the same old long text cutting specially in half bullets --

2: Long and Large Text2 ::: Specially in case of half slide when an image and bullet points are side by side then this problem is aggravated.

3: use all slide formats and do not make slides boring.

4: use default assets/images if prignal not provided


Good Examples:
impressive using left image and right bullets in next slide right image and left bullets --salute
